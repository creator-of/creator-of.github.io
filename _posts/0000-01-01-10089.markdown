Creation of Whatever

This artwork is a social experiment using David as an alter-ego for myself. The composition shows how dystopic is nowdays when we talk about bull and bear markets in stocks, crypto and now NFTs.

This web collage uses the Creation of Adam from the Sistine Chapel judding David attitudes, like when you start to build something disruptive.

The interactive part are the main identity of the QR Codes, now on, you must follow-on to discover!

This artwork is avaiable in limited series: 1/10 for 2 $XTZ @ [Hic et Nunc](https://www.hicetnunc.xyz/objkt/10089)
