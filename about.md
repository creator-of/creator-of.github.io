I use opensource tools to create my virtual collages.

In this work the visitor are invited to interact through QRCodes.

Some collages use paintings from other moviments and eras interacting between each other in a contemporary statement of art.

#### Personal statement
My journey as an artist started in 1998, drawing and painting. Few years later I begun my studies on computer development, and got a few jobs building web sites for agencies, mmeanwhile my artistic carreer was aside.

In 2016 I joined in a new adventure, back in art painting in a traditional matter, acrylics and oil. In this meantime I had a few exhibitions around the world in places like: Paris, Helsinki, Osaka, New York, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo in galleries and art fairs.

Stepping forward, 2018 was a decisive year to start my own business and play a role as private investor in projects I believe.

2021, another journey has begin as a Crypto Artist selling goodies on Tezos protocol.
